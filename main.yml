  description: >
    Cost Management is an application that provides users a view of their 
    enterprise cost. Cost Management allows users to evaluate the cost on 
    infrastructures like Amazon Web Services (AWS) across multiple *master* 
    accounts, breaking down to service usage, compute usage, and storage 
    allocation. Details can also be broken down utilizing tagging to view 
    data attributed to project or cost center assignments. Cost Management 
    also allows users to breakdown cost at the platform level by associating 
    cost with OpenShift clusters, nodes, and the projects running their. Cost 
    can be determined by deriving it from the underlying infrastructure (like 
    AWS) or deriving it based on a user set of rates.
